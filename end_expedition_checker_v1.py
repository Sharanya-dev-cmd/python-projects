# FIXES
# after invalid input, the input isn't asked again -> loops will fix this : LEARN IT
# make it more detailed later
# what if user enters text instead of a number in obsidian, arrows, food amounts, blocks, potions, water buckets and cauldrons? -> ValueError
# stop user from entering negative numbers
# even if the user doesn't meet the previous categories, the next question is asked anyways
# clean code + fix repetition
# better handling of invalid inputs
# apparently i need to learn error handling like 'try:' and 'accept:' or something like that. this will fix comment 3 (under 'fixes')

# and omg this is my first project ive made that's this long! it took 5 days to make this! im so feeling like a genius rn 😎

# oh and imma learn functions and dictionaries next so i can stop relying of conditionals and too many variables so much
# also i think it'll  help if i learn lists and loops too
