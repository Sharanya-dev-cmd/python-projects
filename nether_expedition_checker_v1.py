# VERSION 2 (of this project)
# better handling of invalid inputs
# try to score readiness instead of pass/fail
# check armor quality
# check enchantments of tools and weapons
# distinguishing wooden vs netherite gear in code and final readiness
# allow many food types
# stop user from entering negative numbers
# clean code + fix repetition


# FUTURE IDEAS
# later check enchantments for all tools and weapons
# create a nether guide on all mobs and drops
# create an end expedition checker
# make a directory on all mobs, drops, elytra and ender dragon head of the end
# create a code on readiness checker of how ready the player if to beat the ender dragon
# readiness checker on how ready the player is to beat the boss mob (wither)
# finding the deep dark
# readiness checker on how ready the player is to beat the warden
# finding amethyst caves + find, drops and their usefulness
# minecraft biome directory - mobs, drops, trees, unique finds
# guide to brewing potions
# locating a stronghold 
# village safety checker
# check if player has enough resources to start a starter base
